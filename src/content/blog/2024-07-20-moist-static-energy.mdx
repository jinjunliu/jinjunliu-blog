## Introduction

According to wikipedia, the concept of moist static energy is:

> The moist static energy is a thermodynamic variable that describes the state of an air parcel, and is similar to the equivalent potential temperature. The moist static energy is a combination of a parcel's enthalpy due to an air parcel's internal energy and energy required to make room for it, its potential energy due to its height above the surface, and the latent energy due to water vapor present in the air parcel. It is a useful variable for researching the atmosphere because, like several other similar variables, it is approximately conserved during adiabatic ascent and descent.

To calculate the moist static energy, we need to know the temperature, pressure, and specific humidity of the air parcel. The formula is:

$$ MSE = C_p T + gz + L_v q $$

where:

- $MSE$ is the moist static energy
- $C_p$ is the specific heat of air at constant pressure
- $T$ is the temperature
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity
- $z$ is the height above the surface
- $L_v$ is the latent heat of vaporization
- $q$ is the specific humidity

## Calculation with Python

An example of calculating the moist static energy with Python is shown below:
